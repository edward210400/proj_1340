Problem statement: As a first year student, most of us are living away from home and becoming more independent. One of the aspect that goes hand in hand with becoming more independent is managing our money. We realize that our friends and ourselves find it difficult to manage our expenses and often forget what we spent our money on. Hence, recognizing the problems with managing expenses that our friends and us face, we decided to make a program to help us manage our expenses. 

Problem setiing:
We assume that the user of the program is a University student. By using this program, the user could track down their past spending. The program could also set the budget for monthly spendings. By implementing this, the user should be able to know what cause them to overspend. 

Program features:
  1. Allow the user to see their past spending.
  2. Allow the user to set their monthly budget and give an warning when their spendin almost reach the budget.
  3. Allow the user to input their amount of money and calculate how much they have left.
