Problem statement: As first year students, most of us are living away from home and becoming more independent. One of the aspect that goes hand in hand with becoming more independent is managing our money. We realize that our friends and ourselves find it difficult to manage our expenses and often forget what we spent our money on. Hence, recognizing the problems with managing expenses that our friends and us face, we decided to make a program to help us manage our expenses. 

Problem setting:
We assume that the user of the program is a University student. By using this program, the user could track down their past spending. The program could also set the budget for monthly spendings. By implementing this, the user should be able to know what cause them to overspend. The user would be warned if their spending almost reach the monthly budget. The program would be useful to manage their fiancial status. An interesting feature that could separate this program from other programs is that their spending can be categorized based on where they spent their money and also get tips to save better based on their data. Lastly, the program will also provide them with monthly reports on where they spent their money.

Program features:
  1. Allows the user to see their past spending.
  2. Allows the user to set their monthly budget and give an warning when their spending almost reach the budget.
  3. Allows the user to input their amount of money and calculate how much they have left.
  4. Allows the user to see the date when they spend their money and on which category it was spent on.
  6. Allows the user to remove a specific spending.
  7. Allow user to categorize their spendings. For example: food, shopping, transportation etc. 
  9. Provide them with tips on how they can save more money. The program will provide details on how much money they can spend each day and provide a recommended amount of spending in each category.
  10. Provide users with a monthly report on where they spent their most money based on the categories.
