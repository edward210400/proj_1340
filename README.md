Problem statement: As a first year student, most of us are living away from home and becoming more independent. One of the aspect that goes hand in hand with becoming more independent is managing our money. We realize that our friends and ourselves find it difficult to manage our expenses and often forget what we spent our money on. Hence, recognizing the problems with managing expenses that our friends and us face, we decided to make a program to help us manage our expenses.
